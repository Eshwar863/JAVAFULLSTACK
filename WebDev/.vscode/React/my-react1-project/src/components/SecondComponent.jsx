// This is a React functional component that renders a simple "Second" text inside a div.
// It is a basic example of how to create and export a functional component in React.

import React from 'react'

function SecondComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Second
        {props.name}
      </h2>
    </div>
  )
}
// This is a simple React functional component named `Second`.
// It returns a `div` containing the text "Second".
// The component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other files.
// Functional components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and do not have their own state or lifecycle methods.
// This component can be used in other parts of the application to display the text "Second" on the screen.
// To use this component, you can import it in another file like this:
// import Second from './path/to/Second';
// Then, you can include it in the JSX of another component like this:
// <Second />
// This will render the `div` with the text "Second" wherever you place the `<Second />` tag.
// Functional components like this one are often used for presentational purposes, where they simply render UI without managing state or side effects.

// Note: Ensure that the file path in the import statement matches the actual location of the `Second` component file in your project structure.
